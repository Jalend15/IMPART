 Image Matching and Pairing with Adapted RA-CLIP Technology

#Abstract
Our project seeks to enhance the RA-CLIP model, which utilizes RAM with CLIP for efficient image-text pairing, by adapting it to handle noisier datasets such as blurry images or non-systematic datasets like textbook diagrams. We aim to tailor our querying dataset based on specific domains and assess performance using standard metrics alongside novel downstream tasks. For instance, our model could identify relevant video frames from CCTV footage of a car or match diagrams to those found in textbooks. Initial evaluations will establish benchmarks, with subsequent improvements documented as project milestones.
